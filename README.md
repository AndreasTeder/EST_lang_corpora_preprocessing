# EST_lang_corpora_preprocessing
## Introduction
This is the repository for the Bachelor's degree project of preprocessing speech corpora. In specific, the work focuses on removing leading and trailing silences and trimming of long pauses in the middle. The effect of the silence removal was later graded on speech synthesis models.  
  
2 methods were created for this purpose, which can be found in the Jupyter Notebook [SilenceRemovalMethods.ipynb](SilenceRemovalMethods.ipynb). One of the created methods uses RMSE and ZCR based features to spot and remove silences. The other method uses an acustic model based text alligner - [Autosegmenteerija 2.0](https://bark.phon.ioc.ee/autosegment2/) - the work of Tanel Alum√§e, Ottokar Tilk and Asadullah. In order to use the Autosegmenteerija to create the needed TextGrids for silence removal, the Jupter Notebook [AutosegmentedTextGridCreator.ipynb](AutosegmentedTextGridCreator.ipynb) was created. The last notebook does not come with Autosegmenteerija itself, so having it running somewhere is a prerequisite.  
  
Both the results for the preprocessing methods and for the models can be seen in [Grading.xlsx](Grading.xlsx)
## Requirements for running the Notebooks

## Models
3 models were created for the purpose of this work using [the Deep Voice 3 adaptation for Estonian](https://github.com/TartuNLP/deepvoice3_pytorch). For instructions on how to use the models, please refer to the previous link.  
The models can be downloaded from here:
* [RMSE + ZCR model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w12Aof799pMBMuvNBFFIV02WkvJjVWxN/view?usp=sharing)
* [Autosegment with text preprocessing model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rEJRWDKqCtKIOosD5he4clmBjIfeeAuC/view?usp=sharing)
* [Autosegment without text preprocessing model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13F77LM64kfe3gKazMerYBMOzTV_QnowX/view?usp=sharing)
