# EST_lang_corpora_preprocessing
## Introduction
This is the repository for the Bachelor's degree project of preprocessing speech corpora. In specific, the work focuses on removing leading and trailing silences and trimming of long pauses in the middle. The effect of the silence removal was later graded on speech synthesis models.  
  
2 methods were created for this purpose, which can be found in the Jupyter Notebook [SilenceRemovalMethods.ipynb](SilenceRemovalMethods.ipynb). One of the created methods uses RMSE and ZCR based features to spot and remove silences. The other method uses an acustic model based text alligner - [Autosegmenteerija 2.0](https://bark.phon.ioc.ee/autosegment2/) - the work of Tanel AlumÃ¤e, Ottokar Tilk and Asadullah. In order to use the Autosegmenteerija to create the needed TextGrids for silence removal, the Jupter Notebook [AutosegmentedTextGridCreator.ipynb](AutosegmentedTextGridCreator.ipynb) was created. The last notebook does not come with Autosegmenteerija itself, so having it running somewhere is a prerequisite.  
  
Both the results for the preprocessing methods and for the models can be seen in [Grading.xlsx](Grading.xlsx)
